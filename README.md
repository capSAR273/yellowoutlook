# What is this?
A yellow Outlook Icon! I liked the classic yellow color of the icon from previous versions of the application, so I decided to edit my own version. This should be more distinct from Vision and Word, which are both blue icons now. If you have a suggestion on changes to the icon please create an issue and I'll check it out.
